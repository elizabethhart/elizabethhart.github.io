	<p>My other work can be found on <a href="https://ewhart2.imgur.com/">Imgur</a>.</p>

	<p>Here is a link to a similar page for a <a href="http://www.benasart.com/">professional artist</a>. The source code for this page is a lot more complicated than the one I have created, and also includes lots of classes, etc for linking to their CSS. The code is good because there are several comments indicating what each section is for. The only issue I saw with the page was that the nested tags within the body didn't seem to be properly indented, making it a little hard to follow.</p>
